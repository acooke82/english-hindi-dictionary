# english-hindi dictionary

A dictionary which stores English, Romanised Hindi, and Devanagari script versions of words along with characteristics of the requested words such as the part of speech, gender, and tense (if applicable). 
The application will accept English surface forms as input and return the applicable characteristics as an output. There are example outputs located in the "documents" folder.

To access the application, you can copy this repo into your own VM or terminal and open it in PyCharm. Once open, run 'docker-compose up' and then access the API either directly through the produced link or run a curl command. The /documents/api_documentation.md file has more detailed instruction regarding loading the API.
